Rock, Paper, Scissors (Python)
This is a small Python project I made while learning the basics. It’s a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game where you play against the computer in a best-of-three match. I added round-by-round score tracking, some random trash talk responses, and a replay menu so you can play multiple matches without restarting the script.
